# Someday

Someday is a web application built with Vue.js that allows users to create a list of things they want to do someday.
Users can add, edit, and delete items from their list, as well as mark items as complete.

## Getting started

To get started with Someday, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. 
Once you have those installed, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

npm install
npm start

This will install the dependencies for the project and start a development server.
You can then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.

## Usage

Once you have the app up and running, you can start creating your list of things to do someday. Simply click the "Add Item" button to create a new item, and then fill in the details of the item you want to add.

You can edit an item by clicking the "Edit" button next to it, and you can delete an item by clicking the "Delete" button.

When you've completed an item on your list, you can mark it as complete by clicking the checkbox next to it. Completed items will be moved to the bottom of the list.
